> # README: Work Plan Diagnosis Flow
> 
> This document outlines the structured workflow defined in the &#x60;ktc-flow-diagnostico.json&#x60; file. The purpose of this flow is to automate the diagnosis and evaluation of a work plan document against a predefined set of instructions, criteria, and templates.
> 
> ## Overview
> 
> The workflow, named &#x60;diagnostico_plano_trabalho&#x60;, is designed to analyze a user-submitted work plan (&#x60;.docx&#x60;, &#x60;.pdf&#x60;, &#x60;.md&#x60;). It assesses the document&#x27;s content field-by-field, calculates adherence scores, and generates a detailed final report with recommendations.
> 
> ## Workflow Steps (&#x60;etapas&#x60;)
> 
> The process is divided into five sequential steps:
> 
> ### 1. File Request (&#x60;SolicitacaoArquivo&#x60;)
> 
> *   **Action:** The system prompts the user to upload their work plan file.
> *   **Process:** Upon receiving the file, it is processed to extract key details, criteria, recommendations, templates, and examples. This information is stored in memory for the subsequent diagnostic steps.
> *   **Confirmation:** The system displays the initial details extracted from the plan and asks the user to confirm before proceeding with the diagnosis.
> 
> ### 2. Knowledge Update (&#x60;AtualizacaoConhecimento&#x60;)
> 
> *   **Action:** The system informs the user that it is updating its knowledge base from the &#x60;productnauta.com&#x60; API.
> *   **Process:** It automatically executes API calls (&#x60;getIndiceBlocos&#x60;, &#x60;getBloco1&#x60;, &#x60;getBloco2&#x60;, etc.) to fetch the latest context and instructions. This ensures the diagnosis is performed using the most current information.
> *   **Confirmation:** The user is notified once the knowledge update is complete.
> 
> ### 3. Diagnosis Menu (&#x60;MenuDiagnostico&#x60;)
> 
> *   **Action:** A menu is presented to the user with the following options:
>     1.  Complete Diagnosis
>     2.  Block-level Diagnosis
>     3.  Go Back
> *   **Process:** The workflow proceeds based on the user&#x27;s selection.
> 
> ### 4. Complete Diagnosis (&#x60;DiagnosticoCompleto&#x60;)
> 
> This is the core evaluation step. It analyzes each field of the work plan individually.
> 
> *   **Process:** For every field, the evaluation is based on a comparison with the instructional files, focusing on four key areas:
>     *   **Criteria Evaluation (&#x60;avaliacao_criterios_campo&#x60;):** Counts all defined criteria for a field and assesses if the content meets each one, generating an adherence percentage (0-100%) per criterion.
>     *   **Characteristics Evaluation (&#x60;avaliacao_caracteristicas&#x60;):** Assesses the content&#x27;s conformity with relevant sub-properties or characteristics, calculating an adherence percentage for each.
>     *   **Template Evaluation (&#x60;avaliacao_template&#x60;):** Compares the field&#x27;s content against the official template to determine a percentage of adherence.
>     *   **Examples Evaluation (&#x60;avaliacao_exemplos&#x60;):** Compares the content against all provided examples, determines an adherence percentage for each, and calculates a final average.
> *   **Scoring:** All individual percentages are saved. A final, weighted score is then calculated for the field. This process is repeated for every field in the work plan.
> 
> ### 5. Final Report (&#x60;RelatorioFinal&#x60;)
> 
> *   **Action:** The system generates and displays the final diagnostic report.
> *   **Format:** The report is structured by blocks and fields. It includes the calculated score and specific recommendations for each field, as well as a total score for each block.
> 
> ## Key Observations (&#x60;observacoes&#x60;)
> 
> *   **Traceability:** All individual adherence percentages (for criteria, characteristics, templates, and examples) are saved to ensure full traceability.
> *   **Methodology:** The diagnosis is executed on a field-by-field basis, with a final weighted score calculated for each.
> *   **Standardization:** This standardized flow guarantees traceability, objectivity, and adherence to the official call for proposals and instructions.
> 
> ## Example Report Structure (&#x60;exemplo_relatorio&#x60;)
> 
> The final report is generated based on the following structure:
> 
> *   **Header:** KTC REVISOR - DIAGNÓSTICO DE PLANO DE TRABALHO
> *   **Company:** &#x60;[company name]&#x60;
> *   **City/State:** &#x60;[city/UF]&#x60;
> *   **Project:** &#x60;[project name]&#x60;
> *   **Thematic Area:** &#x60;[thematic area]&#x60;
> *   **Blocks:**
>     *   **Block Name:** &quot;Dados Cadastrais&quot; (Registration Data)
>     *   **Fields:**
>         *   **Field:** &quot;objetivo geral&quot; (general objective)
>         *   **Items:** 11 (total items evaluated)
>         *   **Adequate:** 9 (items that met criteria)
>         *   **Score:** &quot;83/100&quot;
>         *   **Recommendation:** &quot;Pode melhorar&quot; (Can be improved)
>     *   **Total Block Score:** &quot;83/100&quot;
